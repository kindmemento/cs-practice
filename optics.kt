// OPTICS is a density-based clustering algorithm that extends DBSCAN by introducing an ordering of points based on their reachability distance.
// It produces a reachability plot, allowing users to explore different cluster structures and densities.

// Consider a dataset representing the locations of traffic cameras in a city.
// Using OPTICS, you can identify clusters of cameras based on the density of traffic observations, revealing areas with varying traffic patterns.
