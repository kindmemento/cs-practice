// Monads are a somewhat abstract and often misunderstood concept in programming, particularly prevalent in functional languages.
// They are a type of abstract data type used to represent computations instead of data in domain model.

// To understand monads in a real-world context, let's consider a scenario involving online shopping.
// When you shop online, you go through a series of steps:

// selecting items,
// adding them to a cart,
// applying discounts,
// calculating taxes,
// and finally making a payment.

// Each step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one.
// If something goes wrong at any step (e.g., an item is out of stock, or payment fails), the process stops, and you might receive an error message.

// In programming, monads help manage these kinds of sequential operations, where each step depends on the outcome of the previous one.
// They can handle errors gracefully, allowing your program to continue when something goes wrong in the sequence.
