// The Sieve of Atkin is a modern algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
// It is an optimized version of the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes and tends to perform better for larger number ranges.
// The algorithm uses mathematical properties of quadratic residues to identify potential primes more efficiently.

// Imagine you're working on a software application that requires the generation of a large list of prime numbers,
// for instance, in cryptography for key generation. While the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a comment method
// for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit, the Sieve of Atkin is a modern variant that can be more efficient for larger limits.
