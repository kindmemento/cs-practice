// The Sieve of Atkin is a modern algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
// It is an optimized version of the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes and tends to perform better for larger number ranges.
// The algorithm uses mathematical properties of quadratic residues to identify potential primes more efficiently.
