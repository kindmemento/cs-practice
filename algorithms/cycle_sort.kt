// Cycle Sort is an in-place and comparison-based sorting algorithm.
// It is theoretically optimal in the sense that it minimizes the number of writes to the original array.
// It works by considering each array element and then putting it at its correct position by rotating the cycle of elements involved.

// Imagine you're organizing a deck of cards where each card has a unique number and a specific order.
// Your task is to sort the deck such that each card is placed in its correct position with the minimum number of writes (or movements).
// Cycle Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that is optimal in terms of the number of memory writes.
// It's especially useful when memory write is a costly operation.
