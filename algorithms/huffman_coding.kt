// Huffman Coding is a widely used method of lossless data compression.
// It assigns variable=length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.
// This is achieved by building a binary tree (Huffman Tree), where each leaf node represents a character,
// and the path from the root to the leaf gives the character's binary code.
