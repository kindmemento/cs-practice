// Heap's Algorithm is used for generating all possible permutations of n objects.
// It was first proposed by B.R. Heap in 1963.
// The algorithm is efficient and requires only O(n!) time to generate all permutations.

// Imagine you're organizing a dinner party and want to decide the seating arrangment for your guests.
// You have a specific number of guests and want to consider every possible seating order to ensure the possible conversation dynamics.
// Heap's Algorithm can be used to efficiently generate all possible permutations of the guests' seating order.
