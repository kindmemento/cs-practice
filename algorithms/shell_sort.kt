// Shell Sort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.
// The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, taking every hth element produces a sorted list.
// Such a list is said to be h-sorted. It start by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared.
