// The Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
// It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.
// By repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one, the algorithm eventually reduces this to the case where one of the two numbers is zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.
