// Quickhull is a method of computing the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane.
// It is similar to the divide and conquer approach of QuickSort, hence the name.
// The algorithm works by finding extreme points and recursively finding other extreme points in subsets of the input set.

// Imagine you are developing a geographic mapping application and need to determine the boundary that encompasses a set of points (like cities on a map).
// The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points.
// Quickhull is an algorithm that efficiently finds this convex hull, similar to how an elastic band would snap around the outermost points.
