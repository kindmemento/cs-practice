// The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm computes the maximum flow in a flow network.
// It identifies possible paths from the source to the sink while incrementally increasing the flow along these paths.
// The algorithm continues until no more augmenting paths from the source to the sink are are available.
// The "augmenting path" is a path where the flow can be increased.
