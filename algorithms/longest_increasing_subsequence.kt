// The Longest Increasing Subsequence is a classic problem in computer science that seeks to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence in which the elements are in sorted, increasing order.
// This problem has applications in numerous fields, including bioinformatics and stock market analysis.

// Imagine you're a teacher who has recorded the grades of a student throughout the year, and you want to analyze the longest period of consistent improvement in the student's performance.
// This can be modeled as finding the longest increasing subsequence within a sequence of grades.
