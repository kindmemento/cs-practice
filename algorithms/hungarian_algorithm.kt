// The Hungarian Algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm, is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time.
// It's used to find the optimal assignment that either maximizes the sum of weights (in the case of a maximization problem) or minimizes the sum of costs (in a minimization problem) across all pairs.
