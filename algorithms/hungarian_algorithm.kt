// The Hungarian Algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm, is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time.
// It's used to find the optimal assignment that either maximizes the sum of weights (in the case of a maximization problem) or minimizes the sum of costs (in a minimization problem) across all pairs.

// Imagine you're organizing a sports tournament and need to assign teams to different time slots on various fields.
// Each team has a preference for certain times and fields, and each field-time slot combination can only accomodate one team.
// The goal is to find the assignment that maximizes overall satisfaction or minimizes total cost.
// The Hungarian Algorithm is perfect for this kind of optimization problem, commonly known as the assignment problem.
