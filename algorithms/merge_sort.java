// Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy.
// It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts the sub-arrays, and then merges them to produce the final sorted array.
// It is efficient and stable, making it suitable for sorting large datasets.
