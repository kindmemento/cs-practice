// Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy.
// It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts the sub-arrays, and then merges them to produce the final sorted array.
// It is efficient and stable, making it suitable for sorting large datasets.

// Imagine you have a deck of cards that you want to sort.
// You could use Merge Sort by dividing the deck into two halves, sorting each half separately, and then merging them back together in sorted order.
// This is similar to how you might sort a stack of papers by dividing them into smaller piles, sorting each pile, and then merging them back together.
