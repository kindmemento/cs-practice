// SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N is the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.
// It works by maximizing the margin between different classes and can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks through the use of different kernel functions.

// Imagine you're working on a project to classify emails as spam or not spam.
// The SVM algorithm can be applied to create a decision boundary that effectively separates spam and non-spam emails
// in a high-dimensional space based on features such as the frequency of certain words or patterns.
// SVM is widely used in text and image classification tasks.
