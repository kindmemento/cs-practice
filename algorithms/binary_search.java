// Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array.
// It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the target value, and comparing the target value to the middle element of the subarray.
// The algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.
