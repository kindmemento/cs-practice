// LSH is a method for finding similar items with high probability in high-dimensional data.
// It hashes input items in a way that similar items map to the same "buckets" with high probability, while dissimilar items map to different buckets.
// This enables faster search for approximate nearest neighbors.

// Consider a scenario where you have a large dataset of images, and you want to efficiently find similar images.
// LSH can be applied to hash the images in a way that similar images are likely to have the same hash, enabling quick approximate nearest neighbor searches.
