// Topological Sorting is used to order the vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comex before vertex `v` in the ordering.
// This ordering is possible if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

// Consider the course prerequisites in a university.
// Each course has dependencies (prerequisites) that must be completed before taking the course.
// Topological sorting can be used to determine the order of courses to be taken, ensuring that all prerequisites are fulfilled.
