// You are given a directed or undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges.
// The weights of all edges are non-negative.
// You are also given a starting vertex s.
// Below article discusses finding the lenghts of the shortest paths from a starting vertex s to all other vertices, and output the shortest paths themselves.
