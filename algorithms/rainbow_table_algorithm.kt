// A Rainbow Table is a data structure that's used to speed up the process of determining the plaintext input that corresponds to a given hash output.
// It's essentially a trade-off between time and space:
// by stroing precomputed hashes of possible plaintexts,
// you can quickly find the matching plaintext for a given hash,
// as long as the plaintext exists in your table.

// Imagine you're working in cybersecurity, and you encounter a database breach where passwords are stored as hash values.
// To find out the actual passwords, you might consider a brute-force attack, but it's highly time-consuming.
// A Rainbow Table offers a more efficient method.
// It's precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, primarily used for cracking password hashes.
// By using a Rainbow Table, you can quickly look up the corresponding plaintext for a given hash.
