// Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the k'th smallest element in an unordered list.
// It is related to the Quicksort sorting algorithm and is typically efficient for this task because it works in expected O(n) time complexity.
// It uses a partioning method similar to Quicksort to recursively divide the list.

// Suppose you're participating in a race, and after the race, you want to quickly find the runner who finished in the 5th place.
// Going through the entire list of participants and ordering them from fastest to slowest would be inefficient.
// Quickselect is an algorithm that can find the k'th smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list without sorting the entire list.
