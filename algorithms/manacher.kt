// Manacher's Algorithm is an efficient method to find the longest palindromic substring in linear time.
// Traditional approaches might have quadratic or even cubic time complexity, but Manacher's Algorithm accomplishes this in O(n) time, making it much more suitable for long strings.

// Imagine you're developing a word game where players need to find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.
// A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
// For example, in the string "abcbadad", the longest palindromic substring is "bcacb".
