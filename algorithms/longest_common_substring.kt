// Longest Common Substring algorithm is used to find the longest substring that is present in two given strings.

// Suppose you have two texts, one representing a document and another representing a summary.
// You want to find the longest section of the document that appears in the summary.
// This could help identify the most important parts that are highlighted in the summary.
