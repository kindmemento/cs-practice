// Fibonacci Search is an algorithm which efficiently finds the position of a target value in a sorted array.

// 1. Concept:
// - Fibonacci Search is an efficient search algorithm similar to binary search, but it divides the array into Fibonacci sequence-sized subarrays instead of halves.
// - It works best for uniformly distributed arrays.
