// Bucket Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm for sorting elements that are uniformly distributed across a range.
// It works by distributing elements into several "buckets" and then sorting these buckets individually.
// Each bucket is sorted individually using a different sorting algorithm, typically insertion sort, due to its efficiency with small data sets.
