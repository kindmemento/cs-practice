// Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value.
// It does this for each digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

// Imagine you're organizing a library with thousands of books by their unique 10-digit ISBN numbers.
// Instead of comparing entire numbers, you can sort the books based on each digit, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) and moving to the most significant digit.
// This way, you're effectively grouping and sorting books at each step based on a part of their ISBN, leading to a fully sorted collection.
