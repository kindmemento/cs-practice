// Binary Search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or list.
// It compares the garget value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining search interval based on that comparison.
// The process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.

// Imagine you're looking up a word in a dictionary. Instead of going through each word from the beginning to the end,
// you'd typically open the dictionary to a middle page and see if your word would lie before or after that page.
// You then split the relevant half into another half, and continue until you find your word.
// This method is faster than a linear search through every page, and is essentially a real-life binary search.
