// The Z-Algorithm is a linear-time string matching algorithm that identifies occurences of a pattern within a text.
// It constructs an array, Z, where each entry Z[i] represents the length of the longest substring starting from i that is also a prefix of the text.
// This array is then used to locate occurrences of the pattern within the text.
