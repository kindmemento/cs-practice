// Prim's Algorithm is for minimum spanning tree (MST) construction.
// Prim's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
// It's efficient for dense graphs represented using adjacency matrices or priority queues.

// Imagine you have a city map where cities are nodes and roads between them are weighted edges.
// To minimize the total cost of constructing roads between all cities while ensuring all cities are connected,
// Prim's algorithm can determine the optimal road network.
