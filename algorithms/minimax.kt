// Minimax is a backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory to find the optimal movel for a player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.
// Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique to the Minimax Algorithm that significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated.

// Imagine you're developing an AI for a game like chess or tic-tac-toe.
// Each player can make a series of moves that lead to either winning, losing, or drawing the game.
// The AI needs to evaluate the best possible move, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally.
// The Minimax Algorithm is used here, exploring all possible moves, their consequences, and ultimately choosing the move that maximizes the AI's chance of winning, while minimizing the opponent's.
