// The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).
// It works by considering all pairs of nodes and systematically trying all possible paths between each pair to find the shortest.

// Imagine you're operating a travel agency and you want to determine the shortest paths between all pairs of cities you service, considering all possible routes and modes of transportation.
// The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can help you find these shortest paths between every pair of cities, even if they don't have a direct connection.
