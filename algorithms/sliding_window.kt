// The Sliding Window algorithm is a method for keeping track of a subset of data in a larger dataset.
// It involves creating a 'window' which can either be a fixed size or flexible, that moves through the data to examine different subsets of elements.
// This technique is useful for solving array/string problems efficiently, such as finding the longest substring without repeating characters, maximum sum subarray of size 'k', or smallest subarray with a given sum.
