// Given a set of characters and their frequencies, construct a binary tree where the path from the root to each character is the code for that character.
// The goal is to minimize the total length of the encoded message.

// Imagine you are sending a large text file over a network where bandwidth is limited.
// You want to reduce the size of the file without losing any information.
// Huffman Coding helps by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters, thus compressing the data efficiently.
