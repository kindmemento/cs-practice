// The Shunting Yard algorithm is used to convert infix expressions (where operators are placed between operands) into postfix notation (operators follow their operands).
// It uses a stack to temporarily hold operators and performs a series of operations based on the precedence and associativity of operators.

// Imagine you're designing a calculator application where users can input mathematical expressions containing operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parantheses `(`,`)`.
// The Shunting Yard algorithm can be used to convert these infix expressions into postfix (Reverse Polish notation - RPN) format, which is easier to evaluate using a stack-based approach.
