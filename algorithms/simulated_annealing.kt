// Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem.
// The algorithm randomly explores the solution space, accepting not only changes that improve the solution but also, with a certain probability, changes that worsen it.
// This probability decreases with time, mimicking the cooling of metal, thus reducing the changes of making bad moves as the algorithm progresses.
