// The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the Stable Marriage Algorithm, solves the Stable Marriage Problem by iteratively building a stable match.
// The algorithm involves a series of "proposals" where each unengaged man proposes to the most-preferred woman whom he has not yer proposed.
// Each women then considers the proposals she has received (if any) and tentatively agrees to marry the one she most prefers at that point, rejecting the rest.

// Imagine a dating app that aims to pair up partners based on preferences.
// Each person ranks all members of the opposite sex in order of preference.
// The goal is to find a stable matching, where no two people would prefer to be with each other over their current partners.
// The Gale-Shapley algorithm can solve this problem by finding a stable matching.
