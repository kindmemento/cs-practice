// The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text.
// It works by calculating a hash value for the pattern and for each substring of the text of the same lenght as the pattern.
// If the hash values match, the algorithm then checks if the actual substring and the pattern are identical.
// This avoids the need for character-by-character comparisons in most cases.
