// Backtracking is an algorithm paradigm that tries different solutions until it finds a solution that works.
// It is used when you need to find all (or some) solutions to a problem that satisfies specific constraints.
// Backtracking incrementally builds candidates for the solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possible be completed to a valid solution.

// Consider a puzzle where you need to place N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
// This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.
// The N-Queens Problem is a classic example where the backtracking algorithm is used to systematically explore the possible arrangements of queens on the board.
