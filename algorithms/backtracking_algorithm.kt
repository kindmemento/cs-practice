// Backtracking is an algorithm paradigm that tries different solutions until it finds a solution that works.
// It is used when you need to find all (or some) solutions to a problem that satisfies specific constraints.
// Backtracking incrementally builds candidates for the solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possible be completed to a valid solution.
