// The Levenshtein Distance Algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.
// This metric is useful in applications where text strings need to be compared in a flexible manner, accounting for possible typos.

// Consider a spell checker that suggests corrections for a misspelled word.
// The algorithm calculates how many single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) are necessary to change one word into another,
// helping the spell checker determine the most similar correct words to suggest.
