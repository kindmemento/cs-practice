// FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern growth) is an algorithm for mining frequent itemsets without generating candidate sets explicitly.
// It uses a data structure called an FP-tree (Frequent Pattern tree) to efficiently mine frequent itemsets.

// Consider a retail business analyzing customer purchase data.
// The FP-growth algorithm can identify frequent itemsets, helping the business understand which products are often purchased together.
