// Karger's algorithm repeatedly contracts random edges in the graph until only two vertices remain.
// The remaining vertices represent the two parts of the cut.
// The algorithm has a high probability of finding the correct minimum cut.

// Consider a telecommunication network where you want to find the minimum number of links that need to be removed to disconnect the network into two parts.
// Karger's algorithm can help identify this minimum cut efficiently.
