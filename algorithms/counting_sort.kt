// Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value.
// It works by calculating the number of elements less than each key to determine the position of each key directly in the output array.
// It's efficient for sorting a small range of integers.

// Imagine you're a teacher with a stack of tests scored from 0 to 100, and you want to sort them by score.
// Instead of comparing tests directly, you can create a tally of each score
// (for instance, a list where the index represents the score and the value at that index is the number of tests with that score).
// Then, you can easily reconstruct a sorted list of tests from this tally.
