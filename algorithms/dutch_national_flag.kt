// The Dutch National Flag Algorithm, proposed by Edsger Dijkstra, is used to sort an array of three distinct elements (the classic version uses 0, 1, 2) in linear time and constant space.
// The idea is to maintain four regions in the array:

// 1. Red objects (e.g., 0's)
// 2. White objects (e.g., 1's)
// 3. Blue objects (e.g., 2's)
// Unknown objects

// The algorithm iterates through the array, expanding the regions as it encounters each color.
