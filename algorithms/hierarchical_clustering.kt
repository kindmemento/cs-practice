// Hierarchical Clustering builds a tree of clusters.
// It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).
// In the agglomerative approach, each data point starts as a separate cluster, and pairs of clusters are successively merged based on their similarity.
// In the divisive approach, all data points begin in one cluster, and the algorithm recursively splits clusters.

// Imagine you have a dataset of customer purchase history, and you want to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
// Hierarchical clustering can help identify different levels of similarity among customers, forming a hierarchical structure of clusters.
