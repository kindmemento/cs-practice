// Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is an algorithm used to detect cycles in a sequence, such as a linked list.
// It uses two pointers, usually called the "tortoise" and the "hare", which move at different speeds.
// The hare moves twice as fast as the tortoise.
// If there is a cycle, the hare will eventually meet the tortoise again somewhere inside the cycle.
