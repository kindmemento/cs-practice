// Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is an algorithm used to detect cycles in a sequence, such as a linked list.
// It uses two pointers, usually called the "tortoise" and the "hare", which move at different speeds.
// The hare moves twice as fast as the tortoise.
// If there is a cycle, the hare will eventually meet the tortoise again somewhere inside the cycle.

// Imagine you're creating a fitness tracking application that includes a feature for detecting repetitive patterns or loops in a user's running route.
// Suppose the GPS data forms a linked list where each point is a node; you want to determine if the runner is moving in a loop (circular route) or not.
// Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm can efficiently identify if the linked list of GPS data points has a cycle.
