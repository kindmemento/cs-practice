// The Apriori Algorithm is used for mining frequent itemsets and learning association rules in large databses.
// It's based on the principle that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be a frequent itemset.
// The algorithm iteratively identifies the frequent individual items in the database and extends them to larger itemsets as long as those itemsets appear sufficiently often in the database.

// Imagine you are a data analyst in a retail company, and you want to understand the purchasing behavior of customers to enhance cross-selling strategies.
// For instance, you might want to find out which products are often bought together, like break and butter.
// The Apriori Algorithm can identify these associations or frequent itemsets in transaction databases, enabling effective recommendation systems or targeted marketing.
