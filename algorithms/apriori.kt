// The Apriori Algorithm is used for mining frequent itemsets and learning association rules in large databses.
// It's based on the principle that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be a frequent itemset.
// The algorithm iteratively identifies the frequent individual items in the database and extends them to larger itemsets as long as those itemsets appear sufficiently often in the database.
