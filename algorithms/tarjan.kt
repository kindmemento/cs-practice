// Tarjan's algorithm is used to find all SCCs in a directed graph. A SCC in a directed graph is a set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the set.
// The algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) and has a linear time complexity relative to the number of vertices and edges.
