// Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing the shortest path tree.
// This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

// Imagine you're using a GPS navigation system to find the shortest path from your home to a destination in a city.
// The streets form a graph, and the driving time between intersections represent weights.
// Dijkstra's Algorithm can be used to determine the shortest time route to your destination, considering all possible paths.
