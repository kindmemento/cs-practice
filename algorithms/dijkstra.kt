// Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing the shortest path tree.
// This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

// Imagina you're using a GPS navigation system to find the shortest path from your home to your office in a city.
// The city's road network can be represented as a graph where intersections are nodes, roads are edges, and the time or distance to travel each road segment is the edge weight.
// Dijkstra's Algorithm helps the GPS find the shortest path (in terms of time or distance) from your home to your office.
