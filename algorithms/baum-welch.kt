// The baum-Welch Algorithm is an iterative algorithm used to train Hidden Markov Models (HHMs).
// It's a specific case of the more general Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
// The algorithm finds the unknown parameters (transition and observation probabilities) of an HHM that maximize the likelihood of a given set of observed sequences.
