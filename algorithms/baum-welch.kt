// The baum-Welch Algorithm is an iterative algorithm used to train Hidden Markov Models (HHMs).
// It's a specific case of the more general Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
// The algorithm finds the unknown parameters (transition and observation probabilities) of an HHM that maximize the likelihood of a given set of observed sequences.

// Imagine you're developing a speech recognition system.
// The system needs to understand spoken language, which involves recognizing sequences of sounds and interpreting them as words.
// A Hidden Markov Model can represent the probabilities of different sounds and words following each other.
// However, training this model to accurately represent real-world speech is complex.
// The Baum-Welch Algorithm helps by adjusting the model's parameters to best fit a set of observed training data (speech samples).
