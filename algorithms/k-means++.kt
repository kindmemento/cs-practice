// K-Means++ is an enhancement to the K-Means algorithm for centroid initialization.
// Instead of randomly selecting the initial centroids, K-Means++ uses a probabilistic approach to choose centroids that are likely to be far from each other.
// This helps in achieving better convergence and avoiding poor local optima.

// Imagine you have a dataset of customer transactions, and you want to identify natural groupings of customers based on their purchase behavior.
// K-Means++ can be applied to efficiently initialize the centroids, improving the convergence speed and quality of the clusters.
