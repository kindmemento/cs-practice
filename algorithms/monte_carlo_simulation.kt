// Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational algorithm that relis on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
// The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.
// It's often used when it's infeasible or impossible to compute an exact result with a deterministic algorithm.
