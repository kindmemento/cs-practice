// Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient way to solve the "Maximum Subarray Problem",
// which is the task of finding the largest possible sum of a contiguous subarray within a given one-dimensional array of numbers (which can be negative).
// The key idea of Kadan'es algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array and keep track of the maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments.
