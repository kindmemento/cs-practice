// Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works
// by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and moving it to the beginning.

// Suppose you have a deck of cards that are not in any particular order,
// and you want to arrange them in ascending order based on their values.
// You can use the selection sort algorithm to achieve this.
