// The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
// A keyword is used to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext.
// For each letter in the plaintext, you shift it by the number of positions indicated by the corresponding letter in the keyword, repeating the keyword as necessary.

// Imagine you're sending confidential messages in a scenario where basic encryption is needed.
// While simple ciphers like Caesar's cipher are easy to break due to their predictability, the Vigenere Cipher provides a more secure alternative.
// It uses a keyword to vary the shift of each letter in the plaintext, making it less susceptible to traditional frequency analysis attacks.
