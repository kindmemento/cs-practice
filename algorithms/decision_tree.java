// A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
// It mimics human decision-making by splitting data into branches based on feature values, leading to decisions represented by leaf nodes.

// The tree structure consists of:
// - Root node: Represents the entire dataset.
// - Internal Nodes: Represent features that split data.
// - Branches: Represent outcomes of feature tests.
// - Leaf Nodes: Represent decisions or outcomes.
