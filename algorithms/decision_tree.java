// A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
// It mimics human decision-making by splitting data into branches based on feature values, leading to decisions represented by leaf nodes.

// The tree structure consists of:
// - Root node: Represents the entire dataset.
// - Internal Nodes: Represent features that split data.
// - Branches: Represent outcomes of feature tests.
// - Leaf Nodes: Represent decisions or outcomes.

// Imagine you want to decide whether to play tennis based on weather conditions. The features are:
// - Outlook (Sunny, Overcast, Rainy)
// - Tempreature (Hot, Mild, Cool)
// - Humidity (High, Normal)
// - Wind (Strong, Weak)

// The decision tree can help you decide whether to play tennis by evaluating features.
