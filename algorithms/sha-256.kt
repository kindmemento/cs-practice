// SHA-256 operates by taking an input message of arbitrary length and producing a fixed-size (256-bit) hash value.
// It uses a series of modular arithmetic and bitwise operations to process blocks of the input message and generate the hash value.
// SHA-256 is designed to be collision-resistant, meaning it's computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.
