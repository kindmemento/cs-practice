// Topological Sorting of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge UV from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.
// This algorithm is used in scenarios where there is a dependency between tasks or components.
// It's important to note that topoplogical sorting is possible only if the graph has no directed cycles, i.e., if it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
