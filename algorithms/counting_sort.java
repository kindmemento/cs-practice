// Counting Sort algorithm is a linear-time sorting algorithm suitable for a specific range of integer inputs.
// It works by counting the occurrences of each element and using this information to place the elements in order.
// It requires prior knowledge of the range of elements in the input array.
// The algorithm involves three main steps:

// 1. Counting: Count the occurrences of each element in the input array.
// 2. Computing Cumulative Counts: Calculate cumulative counts to determine the position of each element in the sorted array.
// 3. Sorting: Place each element into its correct position in the output array based on the cumulative counts.
