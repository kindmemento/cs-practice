// The BCNF Decomposition Algorithm is used in database normalization to decompose relation that is not in BCNF into a set of relations that are in BCNF.
// BCNF, a stricter version of the Third Normal Form (3NF), aims to resolve anomalies resulting from functional dependencies in a database.

// Imagine you're designing a database for a university.
// The database includes information about courses, the departments they belong to, and the professors teaching them.
// Over time, you notice that there are redundancies and anomalies due to the way this data is structured.
// To optimize the database, reduce redundancy, and improve data integrity, you can use the BCNF Decomposition Algorithm.
// It helps restructure the database into tables that better represent the relationship between different types of data.

// Represents a table or relation in a database
data class Relation(val attributes: Set<String>, val dependencies: Set<FunctionalDependency>)

// Represents a functional dependency, e.g., "A -> B"
data class FunctionalDependency(val determinant: Set<String>, val dependent: Set<String>)

fun isBCNF(relation: Relation): Boolean {
    // Logic to determine if the relation is in BCNF
    // A relation is in BCNF if for every one of its non-trivial functional dependencies X -> Y, X is a superkey
    return true // Placeholder
}

fun decomposeToBCNF(relation: Relation): Set<Relation> {
    // Decompose the given relation into a set of relations that are in BCNF
    if (isBCNF(relation)) {
        return setOf(relation)
    }

    // Placeholder: Decomposition logic based on the properties of the given relation
    // Typically involves identifying functional dependencies that violate BCNF and decomposing accordingly

    return setOf() // Placeholder
}

fun main() {
    // Example usage
    val attributes = setOf("Course", "Professor", "Department")
    val dependencies = setOf(
        FunctionalDependency(setOf("Course"), setOf("Professor")),
        FunctionalDependency(setOf("Course"), setOf("Department"))
    )

    val relation = Relation(attributes, dependencies)
