// The Gauss-Seidel Method is an iterative technique used for solving a system of linear equations.
// It is particularly useful for large systems where direct methods are not feasible.
// The method assumes the system is in the form Ax=b and iteratively approximates the solution x.
// It is an improvement over the Jacobi method in terms of convergence speed.

// Imagine you're an engineer working on a simulation of physical forces in a building structure.
// Your task involves solving a large system of linear equations that represent varius physical forces and constratins.
// Direct methods like Gaussian elimination can be computationally expensive for large systems.
// The Gauss-Seidel Method provides an iterative approach to approximate the solution more efficiently.
