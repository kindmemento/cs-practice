// The Gauss-Seidel Method is an iterative technique used for solving a system of linear equations.
// It is particularly useful for large systems where direct methods are not feasible.
// The method assumes the system is in the form Ax=b and iteratively approximates the solution x.
// It is an improvement over the Jacobi method in terms of convergence speed.
