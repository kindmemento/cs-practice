// Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures.
// The algorithm starts at the root node (or an arbitrary node for graphs) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

// Supporse you're exploring a cave network. You start at the entrance and at each junction, you choose a tunnel to explore.
// You go as deep as you can, backtracking only when you reach a dead end.
// In computer science, this approach of exhaustive exploration is askin to the Depth-First Search algorithm.
