// K-Medoids is an extension of K-Means that uses actual data points as medoids (cluster representatives).
// It minimizes the sum of dissimilarities (e.g. distance or dissimilarity measure) between data points and their respective medoids.

// Consider a delivery service managing a fleet of vehicles.
// K-Medoids can be applied to cluster vehicle locations, selecting the most centrally located vehicle within each cluster as a representative,
// facilitating efficient route planning.
