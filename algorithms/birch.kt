// bIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) Algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that builds a tree-like structure to represent clusters.
// It efficiently handles large datasets by incrementally updating the structure as new data points arrive.

// Imagine you have a massive dataset of customer transactions in an e-commerce platform.
// BIRCH can be applied to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

// The folllowing dependency is to be added to the build.gradle file:
// implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'
