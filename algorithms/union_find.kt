// The Union-Find algorithm is used to track a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
// It provides near-constant-time operations (amortized) to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.

// Imagine you're managing a social network where users form groups or communities.
// You need a way to quickly determine whether two users are in the same group and to merge different groups when users form connections across them.
// The Union-Find algorithm efficiently handles these queries, making it ideal for scenarios like social networking, where group dynamics change frequently.
