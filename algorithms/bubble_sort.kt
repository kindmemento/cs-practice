// Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
// and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

// Imagine you have a deck of cards, and you want to arrange them in ascending order based on their values.
// You can use the Bubble Sort technique: repeatedly step through the deck, compare each pair of adjacent cards, and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
// This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the deck is sorted.
