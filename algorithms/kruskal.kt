// Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph,
// meaning it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

// Imagine a group of islands, and you're tasked with building bridges to connect all of them.
// Bridges have different costs based on the distance and difficulty of construction.
// Using Kruskal's Algorithm, you can find the most cost-effective way to connect all the islands without forming any cycles (loops).
