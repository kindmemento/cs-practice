// The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the original city.
// Genetic Algorithms mimic the process of natural selection to evolve a population of potential solutions toward an optimal or near-optimal solution.

// Consider a delivery person aiming to minimize travel distance while visiting a set of locations.
// The TSP with Genetic Algorithms can provide a near-optimal route for efficient deliveries.
