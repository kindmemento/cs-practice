// EM is an iterative algorithm that aims to find the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models with missing or incomplete data.
// It consists of two main steps: the E-step (Expectation) and the M-step (Maximization).
// In each iteration, the algorithm refines its estimates until convergence.

// Imagine you have a dataset of customer purchases, but some of the purchase amounts are missing.
// The EM algorithm can be applied to estimate the missing values and identify clusters of customers with similar purchasing patterns.

// The following dependency is to be added to the build.gradle file:
// implementation 'com.github.haifengl:smile-core:2.5.0'
