// LOWESS fits multiple local weighted regressions to the data, assigning different weights to data points based on their proximity to the point being smoothed.
// It is particularly useful for capturing trends in noisy datasets.

// Consider monitoring the daily temperature changes.
// LOWESS can be applied to smooth the temperature data, providing a clearer trend by reducing noise caused by daily fluctuations.
