// The knapsack problem is an optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value.
// You need to determine the number of each item to include in a knapsack so that the total weight doesn't exceed a given limit while maximizing the total value.

// Imagine you're packing for a hiking trip and can only carry a limited amount of weight in your backpack.
// You have several items, each with a specific weight and benefit (e.g. food provides energy, a tent provides shelter etc.).
// You want to maximize the benefit you'll get from the items you bring without overloading your backpack.
