// Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
// It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list,
// and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
// The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist,
// exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
