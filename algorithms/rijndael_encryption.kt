// Rijndael Encryption Algorithm, commonly known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), operates on blocks of data, with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
// It consists of several rounds of substitution, permutation, and linear transformation operations.
// These operations are applied in a specific sequence to transform plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa, using the same key.

// Consider a scenario where you need to securely transfer confidential information, such as financial transactions or personal data, over the internet.
// AES can be employed to encrypt this data before transmission, ensuring its confidentiality even if intercepted by malicious entities.
