// Rijndael Encryption Algorithm, commonly known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), operates on blocks of data, with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
// It consists of several rounds of substitution, permutation, and linear transformation operations.
// These operations are applied in a specific sequence to transform plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa, using the same key.
