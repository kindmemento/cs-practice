// The LCS algorithm is used in computer science to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just wo sequences).
// A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguously.
// The algorithm is useful in many applications, such as diff tools, bioinformatics for DNA sequencing, and in naturel language processing.

// Suppose you're working with two versions of a text document and you want to find the longest sequence of words (or characters) that appears in both versions.
// This is a common problem in version control systems and text comparison tools.
// The Longest Commong Subsequence algorithm can efficiently find this sequence.
