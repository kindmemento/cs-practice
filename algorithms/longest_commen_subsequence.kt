// The LCS algorithm is used in computer science to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just wo sequences).
// A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguously.
// The algorithm is useful in many applications, such as diff tools, bioinformatics for DNA sequencing, and in naturel language processing.
