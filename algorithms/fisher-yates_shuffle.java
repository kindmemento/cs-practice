// The Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm, also known as the Knuth Shuffle, works by iteratively selecting a random element from the remaining unshuffled elements, and swapping it with the current element.
// This process ensures that every element is equally likely to end up in any position of the shuffled array.
