// Cocktail Shaker Sort is a variation of Bubble Sort.
// While Bubble Sort only passes through the list in one direction (either up or down),
// Cocktail Shaker Sort passes alternately frmo bottom to top and then from top to bottom.
// This bidirectional approach helps in moving items to their positions faster,
// thus improving performance over the regular Bubble Sort in certain cases,
// especially where items at the end need to be moved to the beginning.
