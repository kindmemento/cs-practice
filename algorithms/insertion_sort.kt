// Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that build the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
// It is much less efficient on lage lists than more advanced algorithms like quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
// However, it has several advantages, such as simple implementation, efficient for small data sets, and more efficent in practice than most other simple quadratic algorithms (like selection sort or bubble sort)
