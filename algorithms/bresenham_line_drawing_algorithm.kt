// Bresenham's Algorithm is an efficient way to draw a straight line between two points in a computer graphics context.
// It determines which pixels should be plotted in order to form a close approximation of a straight line between two points.
// The algorithm works by iterating over the dominant axis (either x or y) and calculating the minor axis pixel based on a decision variable.
// It requires only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, all of which are very fast operations.

// Imagine you're developing a graphics drawing application where you need to draw straight lines between points on a raster grid (like pixels on a computer screen).
// While you could use a simple equation of a line for this, it would require floating-point arithmetic, which is computationally expensive.
// Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm provides an efficient way to draw lines using only integer arithmetic, making it well-suited for computer graphics where performance is key.
