// The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
// BFS starts at a specific node of a graph, visits all of its neighbors at the present depth, and then moves on to the nodes at the next depth level.

// BFS can be applied to find the shortest path in a network, such as the shortest route to travel from one city to another in a transportation network.
