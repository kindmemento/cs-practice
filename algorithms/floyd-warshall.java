// The Floyd-Warshal algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, including negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
// It computes the shortest paths in a dynamic programming manner by considering all possible paths through an intermediate vertex.

// Imagine a scenario where you need to find the shortest path between all pairs of cities in a transportation network, considering different direct routes between cities.
// The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to compute these shortest paths efficently.
