// The Gift Wrapping algorithm is a method of computing the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane.
// The algorithm works by starting from the leftmost point (or the point with the lowest x-coordinate) and wrapping the hull around the set of points, much like wrapping a gift.
// At each step, it selects the point that is the most counterclockwise relative to the current point, continuing until it wraps back around to the starting point.
