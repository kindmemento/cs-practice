// Bitonic Sort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also a comparison-based sorting algorithm and is used mainly in parallel computing.
// A sequence is called bitonic if it is a sequence of "x0​≤x1​≤...≤xk​≥xk+1​≥...≥xn−1" for some k (0 ≤ � k < � n), or a circular shift of such a sequence.
// Bitonic Sort first produces a bitonic sequence frmo the unsorted input, and then it sorts the bitonic sequence.

// Imagine you're managaing a large-scale, parallel processing system where you need to sort vast amounts of data quickly.
// In such a scenario, traditional sorting algorithms might not be efficient due to their sequential nature.
// Bitonic Sort, however, is designed for parallel processing, where multiple comparisons and swaps can be executed simultaneously,
// significantly reducing the sorting time.
