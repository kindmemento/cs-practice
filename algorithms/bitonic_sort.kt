// Bitonic Sort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also a comparison-based sorting algorithm and is used mainly in parallel computing.
// A sequence is called bitonic if it is a sequence of "x0​≤x1​≤...≤xk​≥xk+1​≥...≥xn−1" for some k (0 ≤ � k < � n), or a circular shift of such a sequence.
// Bitonic Sort first produces a bitonic sequence frmo the unsorted input, and then it sorts the bitonic sequence.
