// Affinity Propagation is a clustering algorithm that does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.
// It considers each data point as a potential exemplar and iteratively updates messages between data points to determine the most suitable exemplars.

// Consider a social network where individuals interact with each other.
// Affinity Propagation can be applied to identify key influencers or individuals who serve as exemplars, representing different social groups.

// The following dependency is to be added to the build.gradle file:
// implementation 'com.github.haifengl:smile-core:2.5.0'
