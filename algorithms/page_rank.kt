// The PageRank algorithm is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.
// Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while at Stanford University, it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents,
// such as the world Wide Web, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.

// Imagine you're creating a search engine, and you need to rank websites based on their importance and relevance.
// The PageRank algorithm can help with this.
// It ranks each website based on the number and quality of links to it, under the assumption that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
