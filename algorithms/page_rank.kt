// The PageRank algorithm is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.
// Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while at Stanford University, it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents,
// such as the world Wide Web, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.
