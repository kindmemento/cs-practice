// The Lehmer Random Number Generator is a type of linear congruential generator,
// one of the oldest and simplest methods for generating sequences of pseudorandom numbers.
// The generator works on the principle of taking the remainder of a linear equation to produce the next number in the sequence.

// Suppose you're developing a mobile game, and you need a reliable way to generate random numbers for various game mechanics, like determining loot drops or enemy behavior.
// A random number generator like Lehmer's can provide a sequence of pseudorandom numbers based on an initial seed.
// Such generators are crucial in games and simulations where controlled randomness is required.
