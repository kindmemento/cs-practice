// Interpolation Search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered numerical values assigned to the keys (key values).
// It works on the principle of estimating the position of the key based on the lowest and highest elements in the array and the value of the key.
// It's particularly efficient for uniformly distributed data, where it can achieve O(log log n) complexity, as opposed to Binary Search's O(log n).
