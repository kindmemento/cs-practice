// The Miller-Rabin Primality Test is a probabilistic algorithm that determines whether a given number is prime.
// It's an enhancement over simpler deterministic tests due to its efficiency with large numbers.
// While it doesn't conclusively prove a number is prime, it can tell with high probability whether a number is composite.
// For cryptographic applications, this level of certainty isusually sufficient.
