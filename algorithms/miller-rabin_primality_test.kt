// The Miller-Rabin Primality Test is a probabilistic algorithm that determines whether a given number is prime.
// It's an enhancement over simpler deterministic tests due to its efficiency with large numbers.
// While it doesn't conclusively prove a number is prime, it can tell with high probability whether a number is composite.
// For cryptographic applications, this level of certainty isusually sufficient.

// Imagine you're developing a security application where you need to generate large prime numbers for encryption keys, like in RSA encryption.
// Checking if large numbers are prime using simple methods (like trial division) is computationally expensive.
// The Miller-Rabin Primality Test provides a probabilistic method to quickly check if a number is prime, which is particularly useful for large numbers.
