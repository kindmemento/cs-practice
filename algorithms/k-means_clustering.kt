// K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into 'k' numbers of clusters.
// The algorithm initializes 'k' centroids randomly, then iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and recomputes the centroid of each cluster until convergence or for a fixed number of iterations.
