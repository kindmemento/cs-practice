// A Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a single character of a key.
// The root node represents an empty string, and each subsequent node represents a character in the key.
// The path from the root to a particular node forms the key associated with that node.
// Trie nodes typically have pointers to child nodes, representing the characters that can follow the current character in the key.
// Trie nodes may also contain additional information such as whether the node represents the end of a word.
