// The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph.
// It's an improvement over the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for this specific problem.

// Imagine a scenario where you have a set of applicants and a set of job positions,
// and you want to match applicants to job positions such that each job position is filled with a suitable applicant.
// The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm can efficiently find the maximum number of such matches in a bipartite graph,
// ensuring that every job position is assigned to exactly one applicant.
