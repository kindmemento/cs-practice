// A Bézier Curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields.
// The simplest form is the linear Bézier curve, which is a straight line.
// The quadratic and cubic Bézier curvers are more commonly used, defined by three and four points, respectively.
// The algorithm uses a recursive approach to divide the curve into smaller segments, each approximating the curve.
