// The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items selected, given a weight constraint.
// There are two main variations of the problem: 0/1 Knapsack (where items cannot be divided) and Fractional Knapsack (where items can be taken in fractions).
