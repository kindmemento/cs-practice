// Longest Common Subsequence is used to find the longest subsequence that is common between two sequences (strings, arrays, etc.)

// Consider two sequences of characters, such as DNA sequence or sentences.
// The LCS algorithm can determine the longest sequence of characters that appears in both sequences.
// This can be useful in applications like plagiarism detection, where it's necessary to find similarities between two pieces of text.
