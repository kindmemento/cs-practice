// A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations.
// It is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, makint it ideal for use in databases and file systems.

// Imagine you're designing a database management system for a large-scale e-commerce platform.
// Each product entry needs to be stored efficiently to enable fast searches, insertions, and deletions.
// The B-tree algorithm can efficiently organize and manage the product data, ensuring quick access to information even with millions of products.
