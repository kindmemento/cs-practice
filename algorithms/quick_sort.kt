// QuickSort is an efficient, in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm.
// It works on the divide-and-conquer principle, where the main idea is to select a 'pivot' element,
// and partition the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are to its left,
// and all elements greater than the pivot are to its right.
// This process is recursively applied to the two sub-arrays, leading to a sorted list.
