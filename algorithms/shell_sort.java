// Shell Short algorithm is an extension of and an improvement over the Insertion Sort.
// It uses a sequence of increments (gaps) to sort elements.
// It starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then gradually reduces the gap between elements to perform a final Insertion Sort.
// The idea is to move elements faster towards their expected position.

// Imagine you have a list of tasks to do, each with a priority level.
// You want to sort these tasks based on priority but prefer to tackle similar priority tasks together for efficiency.
