// The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that constructs a finite-state matching from a set of strings (like a trie with additional links between the various internal nodes).
// It can match all strings simultaneously in a text, making it efficient for searching multiple patterns.
// This is particularly useful in applications like search engines, text analysis, and digital content filtering.
