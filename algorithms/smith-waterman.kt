// The Smith-Waterman algorithm is an extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
// It finds the optimal local alignment between two sequences by maximizing a similarity score and allowing gaps (insertions and deletions) within the sequences.

// Consider you have two DNA sequences and you want to find the optimal alignment between them, considering mutations, insertions, and deletions.
// The Smith-Waterman algorithm can help you find the best local alignment, highlighting the regions of similarity and dissimilarity between the sequences.
