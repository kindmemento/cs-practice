// The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network, which is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it.
// The algorithm iteratively finds augmenting paths (paths from source to sink with available capacity) and increases the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths exist.
