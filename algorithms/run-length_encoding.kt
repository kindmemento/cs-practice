// Run Length Encoding is a data compression technique in which consecutive data elements (pixels, characters, etc.) are replaced by just one data value and a count.
// It's most efficient on data that contains many such runs, makint it well-suited for compressing images, text documents with many spaces, or any data with repeated elements.
