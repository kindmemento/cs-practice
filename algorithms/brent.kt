// Brent's Algorithm is an algorithm for cycle detection in sequences.
// It is similar to Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm but more efficient, as it requires fewer function evaluations.
// Bren't Algorithm determines the length of the cycle and the position where the cycle starts in a sequence.

// Consider you're developing a software for a health monitoring system where you're analyzing heart rate data.
// The heart rate data is a sequence that might exhibit cyclic patterns, indicating regular or irregular heart rhythms.
// Detecting these cycles efficiently is crucial.
// Brent's Algorithm is an effective method for finding the length of the cycle and the start of the cycle in such sequences.
