// A* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that is used to find the shortest path from starting point to a goal.
// It uses a combination of the actual distance from the start and an estimate (heuristic) of the distance to the goal and prioritize nodes.

// Consider a GPS navigation system that helps you find the shortest route from your current location to a destination.
// While there might be many possible routes, A* helps identify the most efficient one, taking into account the actual distance traveled and an estimate of the remaining distance.
