// Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
// It is often used to traverse or search through trees or graphs.

// Consider a scenario where you are trying to navigate through a maze to find the exit.
// In this maze, you have multiple paths to choose from at each intersection.
// Depth First Search would involve exploring one path as far as possible before backtracking and exploring another path.
