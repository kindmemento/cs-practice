// Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
// It starts with a single vertex and continuously adds the lowest-weighted edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside of the tree until all vertices are included.

// Imagine you're planning the layout of a network of roads to connect several towns.
// You want to minimize the total length of the roads while ensuring that all towns are connected.
// This is a case where Prim's Algorithm is useful: it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree including every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
