// SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix A into three matrices U, Σ, and V^T, such that:

// A=UΣV^T

// U is an m x m orthogonal matrix containing the left singular vectors.
// Σ is an m x n diagonal matrix containing the singular values in descending order.
// V^T is an n×n orthogonal matrix containing the right singular vectors.
