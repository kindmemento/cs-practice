// The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing edges in the graph.
// It starts by assuming an infinite distance for all vertices except the source vertex, which has a distance of 0.
// Then, it relaxes each edge repeatedly, updating the shortest known distance to each vertex until no more updates can be made.
