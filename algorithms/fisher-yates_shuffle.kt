// The Fisher-Yates Shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence - in plain terms, for randomly shuffling the sequence.
// The algorithm runs in O(n) time and is unbiased, meaning every permutation is equally likely.

// Imagine you are creating a digital card game and need to shuffle the deck of cards randomly.
// The Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm is an efficient way to randomly shuffle the elements in an array, ensuring each possible permutation is equally likely.
// This algorithm is also commonly used in algorithms that need random sampling, like in generating a random playlist from a set of songs.
