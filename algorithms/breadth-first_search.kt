// Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
// It starts at the tree root (or an abtirary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the current depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

// Imagine you're playing a game where you're in a large maze and you need to find the shortest path to the exit.
// The maze can be visualized as a graph where each room is a node, and each door connecting two rooms is an edge.
// By using BFS, starting from your current room, you'd first explore all the immediate neighboring rooms, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until you find the exit.
// This ensures you find the shortest path to the exit.
