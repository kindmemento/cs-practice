// The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
// It can handle negative weights, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm.
// The algorithm works by repeatedly relaxing the edges of the graph and minimizing the distance to each vertex from the start vertex over all possible paths.
