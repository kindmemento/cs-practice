// Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics.
// They represent an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization problems.
// Essentially, you start with a population of random solutions (chromosomes), evolve the population over several generations, and select the best ones.

// Imagine you're designing an AI for a racing game, where the goal is to find the optimal path and speed for completing a track in the shortest time.
// There are countless combinations of turns, accelerations, and braking points.
// A genetic algorithm can evolve solutions over generations, much like natural selection, to find an optimal or near-optimal solution that represents the best racing strategy.
