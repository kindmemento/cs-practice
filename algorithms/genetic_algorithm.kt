// Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics.
// They represent an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization problems.
// Essentially, you start with a population of random solutions (chromosomes), evolve the population over several generations, and select the best ones.
