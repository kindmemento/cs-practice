// Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
// It iterates through an input array, removing one element at a time and then inserting it into the correct position in the sorted array.

// Imagine you have a deck of cards that are initially unsorted.
// To sort the deck using insertion sort, you would start with an empty hand and pick up one card at a time from the unsorted deck.
// As you pick up each card, you compare it to the cards already in your hand and insert it into the correct position.
// By the time you've picked up all the cards from the unsorted deck, your hand will contain all the cards sorted from lowest to highest.
