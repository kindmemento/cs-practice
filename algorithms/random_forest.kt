// Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to obtain a more stable and accurate result.
// It introduces randomness during the training process by using bootstrap sampling (randomly selecting subsets of the training data)
// and geature bagging (randomly selecting subsets of features for each tree).
// This helps prevent overfitting and enhances the model's generalization capabilities.

// Consider a scenario where you're working on a project to predict whether a bank loan applicant is likely to default or not.
// The Random Forest algorithm can be employed to create an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data,
// resulting in a more robust and accurate prediction model.
