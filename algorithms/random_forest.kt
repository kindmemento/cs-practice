// Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to obtain a more stable and accurate result.
// It introduces randomness during the training process by using bootstrap sampling (randomly selecting subsets of the training data)
// and geature bagging (randomly selecting subsets of features for each tree).
// This helps prevent overfitting and enhances the model's generalization capabilities.
