// Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure.
// It's similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.
// We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

// Consider organizing a large number of documents by their importance and due date.
// A good approach would be to arrange them into a pile (heap) where the most urgent document is always on top.
// After you complete each document, you rearrange the pile to put the next most urgent document on top.
// This is similar to how Heap sort works with numbers.
