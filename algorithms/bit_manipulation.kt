// Bit Manipulation is a technique which involves performing operations directly on individual bits within binary representations of numbers.
// It's commonly used in various fields like computer science, cryptography, and hardware design.

// 1. Concept: Bit manipulation involves performing logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
// and bitwise shifts (left shift, right shift) on individual bits within binary representations of numbers.
