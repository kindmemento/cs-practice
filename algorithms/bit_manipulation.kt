// Bit Manipulation is a technique which involves performing operations directly on individual bits within binary representations of numbers.
// It's commonly used in various fields like computer science, cryptography, and hardware design.

// 1. Concept: Bit manipulation involves performing logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
// and bitwise shifts (left shift, right shift) on individual bits within binary representations of numbers.

// 2. Applications:
// - Flag Manipulation: Efficiently manage boolean flags using individual bits within an integer.
// - Bitwise Operations: Perform operations like setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits.
// - Bitwise Arithmetic: Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using bitwise operations.
// - Bitwise Representation: Represent data compactly and efficiently, such as encoding information in network protocols or file formats.
