// The Ear Clipping Algorithm is a method for triangulating a polygon by dividing it into triangles.
// It works by finding 'ears' in the polygon, which are triangles that can be cut off (or 'clipped') without cutting into the rest of the polygon.
// An 'ear' is a set of three consecutive vertices A, B, C where the triangle ABC is entirely inside the polygon, and no other vertices of the polygon are inside ABC.
