// Booth's Algorithm is used for finding the lexicogrphical smallest rotation of a string.
// It's an efficient way to solve problems related to circular strings, where the end of the string is conceptually connected to the beginning.

// Suppose you are developing a feature in a music app to identify a song from a snippet of its lyrics.
// The lyrics are circular in nature, meaning the end of the string is connected to the beginning (like in a loop).
// Booth's Algorithm allows you to efficiently find the lexicographically smallest string rotation, which can be used for circular string matching.
