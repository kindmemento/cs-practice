// Strassen's Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used for matrix multiplication.
// It is particularly faster than the standard algorithm for large matrices.
// The key idea behind Strassen's algorithm is that it reduces the number of recursive calls for multiplying submatrices from 8 (in the standard algorithm) to 7,
// using clever additions and subtractions of those products.
// This reduction provides a better run-time complexity.
