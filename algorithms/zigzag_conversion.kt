// The Zigzag Conversion Algorithm rearranges characters of a string into a specified number of rows in a zigzag pattern.
// When reading the text line by line, it results in a different string.
// The algorithm calculates the position of each character in the original string for each row of the zigzag pattern.

// Imagine you're developing a text formatting tool that needs to display text in a zigzag pattern for stylistic purposes.
// For instance, the word "KOTLIN" could be displayed in a two-row zigzag like this:

//K   I
//O T L N

// This kind of pattern is common in certain types of artistic text rendering or playful user interfaces.
