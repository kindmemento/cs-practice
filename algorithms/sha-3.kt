// SHA-3 is based on the Keccak algorithm, which was selected through a public competition organized by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).
// It operates on input data of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-size hash value.
// SHA-3 uses a sponge construction and permutation-based compression function to process input data.
