// In graph theory, a biconnected component (BCC) of a graph is a maximal set of edges such that any two edges are connected to each other by a path of edges which does not pass through the same vertex more than once.
// If a single vertex (called an articulation point or cut vertex) is removed, the BCC will not be disconnected.
// The algorithm typically uses depth-first search (DFS) to find these components.
