// The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm iterates through the array and maintains a candidate variable along with a count variable.
// It scans each element of the array and updates the candidate and count based on certain conditions.
// At the end of the iteration, the algorithm returns the candidate as the majority element if it exists.
