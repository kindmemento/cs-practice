// Boruvka's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the MST of a graph.
// An MST is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all vertices
// without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

// Imagine you have several isolated islands (vertices), and your goal is to build bridges (edges) to connect all the islands with the least amount of construction cost.
// Boruvka's algorithm would help you determine which bridges to build first (starting with the cheapest) to ensure that all islands become connected while minimizing the total cost.
