// A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature (or attribute),
// the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
// The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node.
// The algorithm splits the data into subsets based on the value of the input features,
// and this process is repeated recursively, resulting in a tree-lioke model of decisions.
