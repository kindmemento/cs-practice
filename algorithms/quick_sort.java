// Quicksort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input array into smallar sub-arrays, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
// Quicksort is often used in practice due to its efficiency and effectiveness on average.

// Consider arranging a group of students in ascending order of their heights.
// Quicksort would work by selecting a pivot student, arranging students taller than the pivot to the right and shorter to the left.
// This process continues recursively for the left and right subgroups until the entire group is sorted by height.
