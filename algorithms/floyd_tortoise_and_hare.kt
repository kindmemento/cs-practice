// Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as cycle detection algorithm,
// is used to detect cycles in a linked list efficiently without using any additional data structure.

// Suppose you have a circular race track where racers run around the track.
// Some racers might be faster than others, and eventually, they may meet or overlap if the track is circular.
// The Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm can be used to detect if any two racers ever meet on the track.
