// Queue is a fundamental data structure used for storing and managing data in a specific order.
// It follows the principle of FIFO (First In, First Out), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

// Operations
// - Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
// - Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
// - Peek: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
// - isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty
// - isFull: Checks if the queue is full
