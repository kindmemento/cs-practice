// B-Tree is a balanced tree data structure commonly used in database systems and file systems for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

// 1. Concept: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
// It is designed to work well with secondary storage devices like hard drives and SSDs.

// 2. Properties:
// - Each node in B-Tree can have multiple children.
// - Nodes are kept balanced by ensuring that every leaf node is at the same level.
// - All nodes (except the root) have at least t-1 keys and at most 2t-1 keys, where t is the minimum degree of the B-Tree.
// - Keys within a node are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search operations using binary search.

// 3. Operations:
// - Insertion: When inserting a new key, the B-Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced by splitting nodes if necessary.
// - Deletion: Deleting a key from a B-Tree involves finding the key and removing it while maintaining the tree's balance.
// - Search: Searching for a key in a B-Tree follows a similar process to searching in a binary search tree, but it traverses multiple levels of the tree to find the key.
