// B-Tree is a balanced tree data structure commonly used in database systems and file systems for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

// 1. Concept: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
// It is designed to work well with secondary storage devices like hard drives and SSDs.

// 2. Properties:
// - Each node in B-Tree can have multiple children.
// - Nodes are kept balanced by ensuring that every leaf node is at the same level.
// - All nodes (except the root) have at least t-1 keys and at most 2t-1 keys, where t is the minimum degree of the B-Tree.
// - Keys within a node are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search operations using binary search.
