// The Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance during insertions and deletions.

// 1. Concept: A red-black tree is a binary search tree with the following properties:
// - Each node is colored either red or black.
// - The root is always black.
// - No two red nodes can appear consecutively along any path.
// - Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes (external nodes) has the same number of black nodes.
