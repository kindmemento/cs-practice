// A Circular Buffer is a fixed-size data structure that uses a single, continuous block of memory.
// It behaves as if the memory is connected end-to-end, forming a circle.
// When the buffer is full and a subsequent write occurs, the oldest data in the circular buffer is overwritten with the newest data.
// It's useful in scenarios where old data has not significance after a certain point.
