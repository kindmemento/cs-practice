// A Tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes.
// It is used in computer science for organizing data efficiently.

// Traversal of Tree
// Tree traversal methods are used to visit and process nodes in a tree data structure.
// - In-Order: Visit left subtree, current node, then right subtree.
// - Pre-Order: Visit current node, left subtree, then right subtree.
// - Post-Order: Visit left subtree, right subtree, then current node.
