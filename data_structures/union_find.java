// A Disjoin Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
// It suppors two primary operations efficiently:

// 1. Find: Determine the subset a particular element is in.
// 2. Union: Merge two subsets into a single subset.
