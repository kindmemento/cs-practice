// A Disjoin Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
// It suppors two primary operations efficiently:

// 1. Find: Determine the subset a particular element is in.
// 2. Union: Merge two subsets into a single subset.

// Consider a social network where each person is a node, and friendships are edges.
// We want to determine if two people are in the same friendship group (connected component) or merge two groups when a new friendship is formed.
// The Union-Find data structure efficently handles these operations.
