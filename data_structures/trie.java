// A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings.
// It is used to store words in a way that facilitates fast prefix-based searches.
// Each node in a trie represents a single character, and each path down the tree represents a word.

// Imagine you are designing an autocomplete feature for a search engine.
// As a user types in the search box, you want to suggest possible completions based on the current prefix.
// A trie is an ideal data structure for this task because it allows you to quickly find all words that start with the given prefix.
// For example, if a user types "cat", the trie can quicky suggest "cat", "cater", "catapult" et cetera, based on the stored words.
