// A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
// In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and the highest value is at the root.
// Conversely, in a min heap, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children, with the smallest value at the root.
