// A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
// In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and the highest value is at the root.
// Conversely, in a min heap, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children, with the smallest value at the root.

// imagine you are organizing a series of tasks based on priority, where the most urgent task needs to be addressed first.
// A max heap could be used to model this sscenario, where the highest-priority task is always at the top of the heap.
// When you complete the most urgent task, you remove it from the heap, and the next most urgent task moves to the top.

// Use Cases
// 1. Priority Queue: Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.
// 2. Scheduling Algorithms: In operating systems, heaps can be used to schedule processes.
// 3. Graph Algorithms: Heaps are used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to efficiently find the minimum distance.
