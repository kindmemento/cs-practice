// A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers.
// Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

// Characteristics of Linked List:
// - Dynamic: Linked Lists can be easily resized by adding or removing nodes.
// - Non-contiguous: Nodes are stored in random memory locations and connected by pointers.
// - Sequential access: Nodes can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of the list.
