// A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

// There are two types of heap:
// 1. Max-Heap: For any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
// 2. Min-Heap: For any given node i, the value of I is less than or equal to the values of its children.

// Think of a priority queue system in a hospital. Patients are assigned priority numbers, and the one with the highest priority (like critical condition) is treated first.
// This system can be implemented using a max-heap where the patient with the maximum priority is always at the top.
