// Hash Table Data Structure:

// 1. Structure:
// A hash table is an array-based data structure that stores key-value pairs.
// It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in the array, enabling quick access to values associated with keys.

// 2. Operations:
// Insertion: To insert a key-value pair, the hash function computes the index in the array based on the key's hash code.
// If there's a collision (two keys mapping to the same index), various collision resolution techniques can be employed, such as chaining or open addressing.
// Deletion: Deleting a key-value pair involves locating the key's index using the hash function and removing the entry from the corresponding bucket.
// Retrieval: To retrieve the value associated with a key, the hash function is applied to compute the index, and the value is fetched from the corresponding bucket.

// 3. Advantages:
// - Provides fast insertion, deletion, and retrievel operations on average (O(1)) time complexity.
// - Versatile and widely used in various applications.
// - Can handle large datasets efficiently when properly implemented.

// Consider a library where books are organied based on their unique ISBN (International Standard Book Number).
// A hash table can be used to efficiently manage the books by mapping each ISBN to its corresponding book details.
