// Radix Tree (also known as radix trie or compact prefix tree) is a data structure used for storing a set of keys in a memory-efficient manner, particularly in scenarios where keys are strings.

// 1. Concept:
// A radix tree is a space-optimized trie where each node represents a common prefix shared by its children.
// It is particularly efficient for storing and searching keys with a large common prefix.
