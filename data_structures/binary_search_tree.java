// A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right), and for each node:
// - The left child's key is less than the node's key.
// - The right child's key is greater than the node's key.
// This property enables efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

// Think of a phonebook where entires are stored alphabetically by last name.
// Each entry (node) contains a last name (key) and associated information (value).
// Searching for a specific last name efficiently is analogous to using a BST.
