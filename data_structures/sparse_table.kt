// A Sparse Table is a data structure used primarily for range query problems, especially when the array is static (no updates).
// Once the table is built, it allows for constant-time range queries, making it useful for problems like finding the minimum or maximum value in a given subarray.

// Imagine you're analyzing stock prices over several days, and you want to quickly determine the hgihest price in any given range of days.
// Building a Sparse Table on the stock prices can allow you to query the maximum price in any range of days in constant time.
