// Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.
// Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access.
// Each element has a unique index number.

// Operations on Array:
// - Traversal: Iterating through the elements of an array.
// - Insertion: Adding an element to the array at a specific index.
// - Deletion: Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
// - Searching: Finding an element in the array by its value or index.
