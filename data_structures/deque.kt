// Deque Data Structure

// 1. Structure: Deque is a linear data structure that supports the following operations:
// Insertion and Deletion: Elements can be added or removed from both the front and the back.
// Peek: Retrieving the element at the front or the back without removing it.
// Size: Getting the number of elements in the deque.

// 2. Implementation:
// Deque can be implemented using various underlying data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or doubly linked lists.
// Doubly linked lists are commonly used as they provide efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends with O(1) time complexity.
