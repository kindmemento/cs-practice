// A binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node has at most two children: left and right.
// The topmost node is called the root.

// Key properties:
// 1. Full Binary Tree: Every node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
// 2. Complete Binary Tree: All levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.
// 3. Balanced Binary Tree: The depth of the two subtress of every node never differ by more than 1.
// 4. Binary Search Tree (BST): For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.

// Think of the hierarchy in an organization. The CEO is at the toop (root node). The CEO has two direct reports (two children): the CTO and the CFO.
// The CTO might have two reports: VP of Engineering and VP of Product.
// This can be visualized as a binary tree, where each person is a node, and their direct reports are their children.
