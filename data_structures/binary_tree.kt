// A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child.

// Think of a book and its table of contents.
// The main topics like "Introduction", "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2" can be seen as root or intermediate nodes.
// Subtopics or sections within chapters can be seen as children.
// When each topic is limited to have only two subtopics for simplicity's sake, this structure resembles a binary tree.
