// A Segment Tree is a data structure used to efficiently perform range queries and updated on an array.
// It is particularly useful when you need to perform operations like finding the sum, minimum, or maximum over a range of elements,
// and you also need to update elements frequently.
// The Segment Tree allows you to do both in logarithmic time, making it a powerful tool for scenarios where both updates and queries need to be handled efficiently.

// Consider a scenario where you have an array representing daily sales in a store over a month,
// and you want to frequently query the total sales for any given week or update the sales for a specific day.
// A Segment Tree allows you to do this efficiently.
