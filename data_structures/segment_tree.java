// A Segment Tree is a data structure used to efficiently perform range queries and updated on an array.
// It is particularly useful when you need to perform operations like finding the sum, minimum, or maximum over a range of elements,
// and you also need to update elements frequently.
// The Segment Tree allows you to do both in logarithmic time, making it a powerful tool for scenarios where both updates and queries need to be handled efficiently.
