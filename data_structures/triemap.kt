// TrieMap is a data structure which is a hybrid of a trie and a hash map.
// It combines the efficient prefix search capability of a trie with the quick key-value lookup of a hash map.

// 1. Concept:
// TrieMap is a data structure that combines the properties of a trie and a hash map.
// It organizes keys in a trie-like structure, where each node represents a prefix of the stored keys.
// At the leaf nodes, key-value paris are stored like in a hash map.
