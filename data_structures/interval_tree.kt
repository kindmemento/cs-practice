// Interval Tree is a data structure used to efficiently store and query intervals.

// 1. Concept:
// - An interval tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that stores intervals.
// - Each node in the tree represents an interval, and the subtree rooted at that node contains intervals overlapping with the node's interval.
// - It supports efficient interval-based opertaions such as searching for overlapping intervals and finding all intervals that contain a given point.
