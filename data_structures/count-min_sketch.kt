// The Count-Min Skcetch algorithm is a probabilistic data structure used for approximate counting of events in massive data streams.

// 1. Concept:
// - The Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure designed to provide approximate frequency counts of items in a stream of data.
// - It uses multiple hash functions and an array of counters to store counts.
