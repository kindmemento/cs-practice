// HAC starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains.
// The result is a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, representing the hierarchy of cluster relationships.

// Imagine you have a dataset of customer purchase histories, and you want to identify groups of products that are frequently bought together.
// HAC can be applied to create a hierarchy of product clusters, capturing relationships at different levels of granularity.
